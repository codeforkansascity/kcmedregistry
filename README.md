# KC Medicine Registry

KC Medicine Cabinet uses a paper voucher system to provide funds for medical costs of those in need. Currently there is no system for tracking how these vouchers are issued or redeemed and remitted, making usage data difficult to collect.

KC Medicine Registry will build a digital system to analyze the transaction records for these vouchers, opening up opportunities to analyze patterns, predictions, categories, and trends.
